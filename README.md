# breathing-reminder
A project to use the sense hat to remind a stroke victim to breathe during focused activities, as his brain allows him to stop!
This program is a work in progress. What I need help with is having the program restart from any point to the beginning again when the joystick is moved in any way, similar to how it starts with a movement.
Any help is appreciated. Ultimate goal: he plugs the thing in, puts it in front of him, and it runs for a while before giving him annoying messages. 
Then, when he breathes, he moves the joystick on the pi sense hat and it restarts the timer.
